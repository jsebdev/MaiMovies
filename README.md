## About this project

I realize I didn't have any project using React native to show yet, and I also realized I'm used to receive tons of recommendations of movies and series from my friends but since I don't write them down, I forget many of them.

So! I decided to fix both issues at the same time building this app for me (And for anyone who wants to use it of course)
